## Installing FluidNC on your ESP32

Unpack this FluidNC release Zip file.

Plug your ESP32 into a USB port.

At a shell prompt, cd to this directory and run one of the following commands:

To install the WiFi version:            sh install-wifi.sh
To install the Bluetooth version:       sh install-bt.sh
To replace the ESP32 local filesystem:  sh install-fs.sh

### Local Filesystem Considerations

Replacing the local filesystem is only useful for the wifi version.
The Bluetooth version can start with an empty local filesystem.

The disadvantage of replacing the local filesystem is that it will
overwrite any files that you might already have there, such as FluidNC
config files, WebUI preferences and macros.  The advantage is that you
will get the latest version of the index.html.gz file that contains
the WebUI code.  Another way to get a new index.html.gz is to upload
it via WebUI from wifi/index.html.gz herein.

A good approach is to use install-fs only on your first FluidNC
installation, to start from a clean slate.

### Running Fluidterm

The FluidNC install scripts run Fluidterm automatically at the end,
but if you want to run it separately, you can type

  sh fluidterm.sh

or just

  ./fluidterm.sh

### If Fluidterm Won't Start ...

Fluidterm is intended to be helpful but it is not absolutely necessary
for using FluidNC.  Fluidterm lets you interact directly with FluidNC
over a USB serial port.  There are other ways to do that, so if you
have trouble running Fluidterm, you can just ignore it.

If Fluidterm does not work immediately, you can probably get it to work
by installing Python3 - the language in which Fluidterm is written.
Most Linux distributions will already have Python3 preinstalled.
If you have problems, search the web for "install python3 on linux".

### Alternatives to Fluidterm

Most GCode sender programs have some way to send commands directly to
FluidNC, but it can sometimes be helpful to bypass the complexity of
a sender and use a more direct path.  Fluidterm is one such direct
path, but there are others, typically called "serial terminals".

For Linux, there are many such programs, such as "screen", "minicom", "cu",
"picocom", and "PuTTY".  The one that is most likely to be preinstalled
is named "screen".  If screen is not preinstalled, you might be able to
install it with (on Ubuntu or Debian).

   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install screen

To use screen, go to a shell window and type:

  ls /dev/tty*

That will give you a list of serial ports.  You need to find the one
that is connected to FluidNC.  It will probably have a name that starts
with "/dev/ttyUSB".  Once you have found that name, type

  screen /dev/ttyUSBWHATEVER 115200

To exit from screen, type  Control-A k

Search the web for more documentation about screen, or for instructions
for installing it on other versions of Linux.

### What Can Go Wrong?

If you see an error like this:

  [9481] Error loading Python lib '/tmp/_MEIoyh8ER/libpython3.8.so.1.0': dlopen: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by /tmp/_MEIoyh8ER/libpython3.8.so.1.0)

.. it could be version mismatches between system libraries and the
precompiled esptool executable in the linux-amd64 directory.

The workaround is to run the Python version of esptool - esptool.py - under Python,
instead of using the esptool executable version.  The Internet has many tutorials
for using esptool.py .  You can find the appropriate command line arguments in the
.sh files.
