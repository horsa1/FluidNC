## Installing FluidNC on your ESP32

Unpack this FluidNC release Zip file.

Plug your ESP32 into a USB port, then double-click on one of
the following (or, in a CMD window, CD to this directory and
type the batch file name).

To install the WiFi version:            install-wifi.bat
To install the Bluetooth version:       install-bt.bat
To replace the ESP32 local filesystem:  install-fs.bat

Replacing the local filesystem is only useful for the wifi
version, since its default contents are only needed for
running the WebUI user interface over WiFi.

The disadvantage of replacing the local filesystem is that
it will overwrite any files that you might already have
there, such as FluidNC config files, WebUI preferences
and macros.  The advantage is that you will get the latest
version of the index.html.gz file that contains the WebUI
code.  Another way to get a new index.html.gz is to upload
it via WebUI from wifi/index.html.gz herein.

A good approach is to use install-fs only on your first
FluidNC installation, or to start from a clean slate.
